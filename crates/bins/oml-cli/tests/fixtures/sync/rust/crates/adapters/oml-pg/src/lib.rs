//! `oml-pg` — the real journal-and-metadata store adapter over PostgreSQL
//! (workspace-plan.md M1 step 3), implementing `oml_app::ports::JournalStore`
//! over the committed migrations.
//!
//! The commit point is one transaction (ADR-0002 d1): the signed event, the
//! chain-head upsert, the metadata fold, the outbox row and the idempotency
//! record commit together or not at all. Chain assignment serializes on a
//! transaction-scoped advisory lock per tenant (ADR-0002 d3); the journal is
//! append-only by mechanism (ADR-0002 d4, enforced in `migrations/0001_init.sql`).
//! Every query is the sqlx runtime API — no compile-time checked macros, so
//! no `DATABASE_URL` at build (workspace-plan.md).
